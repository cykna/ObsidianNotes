My Obsidian Notes.
## Reason
I'm reading a book which talks about the web, in case it's James F. Kurose | Keith W. Ross Computer Networking A Top Down Approach. 8th Edition and i'm seeing that it will become a must to create notes, so that's the reason.
## Intention
Note everything I know and I learn to make it accessible to others. So, this is supposed to accept contribution of others about anything they want to talk about that involves programming and the one writing it down finds interesting to share with people

## Observations
As this is open source and I accept contribution, this is language agnostic. I write things MAINLY in rust because i simply prefer so, but that doesn't mean it's going to be the only language on the examples of this repo.
The only requirement is that the notes are written in .md to make it possible to simply copy this repo and open it with obsidian
