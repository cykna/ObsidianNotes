Stream is a way to process data safely and efficiently. It works piece by piece, in chunks. By processing data this way, without loading all data into memory at once, it prevents server overload and improves speed and security.

Streams are heavily used for processing binary data, whether it's bytes or strings.

1. File Processing: Using the fs library, we can create a stream to process a file meaning to read and write it. This is perfect for handling massive log files, uploads, or downloading large files with high efficiency.
2. Network Communication: Streams are frequently used in network communication (like HTTP, TCP, and WebSockets) to efficiently process data in chunks. In this context, they allow you to process the body of HTTP requests and responses, receive file uploads, return large amounts of data from APIs (JSON, XML), and even WebSocket communication uses data streams.
3. Transform Streams: In this case, data is modified while it's being processed, using a combination of readable and writable streams. Data is transformed from one format to another, typically using a pipe. For example: a program processing a huge application log could implement a Transform Stream to filter the log to only show "WARN" and "ERROR" entries.
4. Buffer: When using streams, data doesn't all arrive at once. It comes in chunks. Because of this, each chunk is temporarily stored in a buffer before being processed.

In summary: Streams allow efficient processing of large amounts of data without overloading memory and improving application performance.
