Headers are defined on the section 17 of the specification, they determine how the data will be understood when arriving. For example, an InitialPacket(which is listed below on this file), which is used to transfer data and make a handshake between 2 Ends. The specification determines that the content MUST, contain at least one [[Frames|crypo frame]] and if the content is not the enough(about to 1200 bytes), the content must be filled to get the minimum amount required, thus, it's used the padding frame to do so. There are a specific amount of packets on the version 1:
* Long Header
	A long header is a header which will have an specific type. It is determined on the section 17.2, and contains data about the version, the type of the header, the CDID and SCID. The types a long header can have can be found at the specification at section 17.2 as said above, and are explained below
* Initial Packet.
	Initial Packets are used to do the initial communication between to 2 ends. They are used thus, to make the [[Handshake]]. It's a type of a Long Header. In it's payload(the actual content), we will MUST have a [[Frames|CRYPTO frame]] containing some encrypted data, which will be used to determine if both ends can establish a connection and keep communicating. More information about how it works and why is it for can be found on [[Handshake]]
