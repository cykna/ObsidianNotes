QUIC which does not stand for anything, instead is the name itself of the protocol, is a [[UDP]] based protocol to send data across the internet. It's purpose is to do the same as [[TCP]] protocol, send data across 2 end users in a way that is guaranteed the sent of the content, but not necessarily be the 'new tcp' instead, be a general usage protocol, even though it yes tends to make TCP more obsolete.
The first [[RFC]] specification for it was released at 2016, where it's name did stand for something, it was: Quick UDP-based Internet Connection, as you can see at this [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hamilton-quic-transport-protocol/00/|draft]] which was then updated over and over until the actual RFC 9000, that then doesn't use the term 'QUIC' as an acronym, but the name itself. 
But that doesn't mean it was firstly implemented at 2016, but it started about 4 years earlier, and publicly announced at 2013, one year after it's first implementation. 
QUIC does receive the name of 'TCP/2' for some because of the features it has and how it can be used over TCP, due to the fact that it does make the performance better when used instead of TCP, that is made due to things like [[DataMultiplexing|data multiplexing]], [[Encrypting|encryption]], and others which are implemented by default on QUIC, and as well, as the usage of UDP which is generally faster than TCP.
In fact, QUIC does not send the data directly, the one sending is UDP, what QUIC does is to make a way where 2 end users can talk to each other in a efficient way and without the insecurities that UDP provides, as lost of packets and unordered packets. 
The [[QuicExplanation| explanation]] is made primary because I'm attempting to implement so, and then I'm in need to understand it, but fell free to simply ignore so.
